# Constraints

- There are some limitations whenever we create a project.

## External

- Time Limitations: I have a deadline to complete my portfolio, which can impose
  time constraints on gathering materials, designing, and developing the
  portfolio.

## Internal: Involuntary

- Technical expertise: Depending on my technical skills, I may encounter
  limitations in implementing advanced features, interactive elements in my
  portfolio.
- Time: Amount of time available to work on the project.
